This is an Android client for BookWyrm – a federated social network for tracking your reading, talking about books, writing reviews, and discovering what to read next. It is just BookWyrm put into a webview element, nothing special – but it adds some convenience on top:

* bookwyrm links can be made to open with the app (e.g. clicking on the link to someone's userprofile will open that from your own bookwyrm instance)
* thanks to that, you can immediately follow them easily if you want.
* it lets you easily return to your own home timeline when viewing something like posts, on another bookwyrm instance, because the 'back' button is then modified for that.
* You can also search for books by scanning the ISBN, no matter what instance of Bookwyrm you use.

<b>This application is <u>not</u> an official client!</b> (An official client does not exist yet, as far as I know)
