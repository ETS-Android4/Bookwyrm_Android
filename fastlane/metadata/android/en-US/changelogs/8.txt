* Improved the loading bar.
* The ISBN-scanning feature now works by simply clicking the ISBN button that is used by the instances that have scanning already available.
* For instances that do not support the scanning server-side, there is now instead of the text a button for ISBN-scanning, similar to the standard one.
* More bookwyrm instances added to the ones that can be opened in the app.
* Small bug-fix, so now only ISBN-codes (And other EAN-13 codes) will be scanned.
* Another bug-fix. The modified back button works again.
