# Bookwyrm-android
A crappy attempt at creating an Android application for Bookwyrm. Basically, it is just bookwyrm put into a 'webview' element.
What it does? It enables you to use BookWyrm on your Android phone without having to use a browser to go to it every time.
Currently, it is not able to open links yet, but maybe I will add that sooner or later.

This application works on: Android 6 and above.
