# Bookwyrm-android
A crappy attempt at creating an Android application for Bookwyrm. Basically, it is just bookwyrm put into a 'webview' element.
What it does? It enables you to use BookWyrm on your Android phone without having to use a browser to go to it every time.
It can also open links to userpages of Bookwyrm users.

This application works on: Android 6 and above.
